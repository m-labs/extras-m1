We use desktop publishing software Scribus to design the box
artwork and labels (file extension: .sla).
Please install Scribus 1.4.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribus

We will attempt to make the Scribus files as print-ready as
possible, including CMYK color information, and documentation
on how to create the final PDF file for printing.



--- box_artwork.sla

box.dxf is the outline used for the box die-cutting. We import
it into Inkscape to then save as a temporary .svg file, which we
can then import into Scribus as the initial outline in
box_artwork.sla

Steps to create print-ready box_artwork.pdf:

** open box_artwork.sla with Scribus
** select die-cut outline, Item -> Delete
** File -> Export -> Save as PDF...
    Save
** File -> Close (discard changes)



--- m1_bottom_product_label.sla

This is the main product label to be glued on the bottom side
of each Milkymist One.
Steps to create print-ready m1_bottom_product_label.pdf:

** open m1_bottom_product_label.sla with Scribus
** select label in top left of page
** Item -> Multiple Duplicate
    By Rows & Columns tab
     Number of Rows: 7
     Number of Columns: 3
     Horizontal Gap: 1 mm
     Vertical Gap: 1 mm
    OK
** File -> Export -> Save as PDF...
    Save
** File -> Close (discard changes)



--- m1_bottom_mac_address.sla

The MAC address label is meant to be glued right below the product
label on the bottom of of each Milkymist One. It should have the
same width as the product label.
This is a separate label to go with the copyleft hardware philosophy
that all serial numbers should be documented and easily removable.
By making it a separate label, it is removable without also having
to remove the product label.

Steps to create print-ready m1_bottom_mac_address.pdf:

** open m1_bottom_mac_address.sla with Scribus
** File -> Export -> Save as PDF...
    Save
** File -> Close (discard changes)



--- m1_12v_power_flag.sla & m1_5v_power_flag.sla

Both labels are meant to be wrapped around the DC cable of the 12V
and 5V power supplies, maybe 3-5 cm away from the DC jack. The middle
part of the label is wrapped around the DC cable, the rest is glued
back to back forming a flag.

Steps to create print-ready m1_12v_power_flag.pdf & m1_5v_power_flag.pdf:

** open m1_bottom_mac_address.sla with Scribus
** select label in top left of page
** Item -> Multiple Duplicate
    By Rows & Columns tab
     Number of Rows: 30
     Number of Columns: 3
     Horizontal Gap: 1 mm
     Vertical Gap: 1 mm
    OK
** File -> Export -> Save as PDF...
    Save
** File -> Close (discard changes)
